# RDKit-for-Natia
ქიმიური სტრუქტურების დასახატად

I made this handy guide for masters students in bio/chem that are working on building peptide databases but do not have a background in coding. 🫶
The code can be used for generating 2D structures of various chemical compounds. 
The instructions are in Georgian, since there is hardly any available information on RDKit in any languages but English.
